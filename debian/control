Description: Netfilter Userspace Logging Daemon
 ulogd is a daemon that listens for Netlink packets generated by iptables's
 ULOG target. Basically, it's a replacement for syslog for logging packets,
 and does a much better job - it logs to files, pcap files, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
 SQLite 3 and soon will be able to log remotely.
 .
 MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite 3 support is in separate packages, called 
 ulogd2-mysql, ulogd2-pgsql and ulogd2-sqlite3 respectively. pcap file support
 is in package called ulogd2-pcap.

 file. You can then use this file with other tools that use pcap like
 tcpdump or ethereal.
