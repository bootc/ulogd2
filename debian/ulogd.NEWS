ulogd2 (2.0.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  The ulogd packages containing ulogd-1.x are being replaced by the ulogd2
  packages, containing ulogd-2.x. The configuration file for ulogd is not
  compatible between versions 1.x and 2.x. Please take the time to review
  /etc/ulogd.conf to ensure the file is upgraded to the new format and
  re-incorporate any local changes you may require.
  .
  Please note that the default /etc/ulogd.conf for ulogd2 does NOT enable the
  deprecated ULOG logging target. If you are upgrading from ulogd-1.x, you will
  need to either migrate your iptables ruleset to use NFLOG target instead, or
  enable the ULOG stack in ulogd.conf.
