Support for logging into MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite 3 databases is available
from separate packages called ulogd2-mysql, ulogd2-pgsql and ulogd2-sqlite3 
respectively.

You can also log packets in pcap file format, using package ulogd2-pcap.

Don't forget to adapt your /etc/ulogd.conf to those modules. Example 
configuration is included.
